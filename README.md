# Machine Learning Models Notebook

This notebook demonstrates the implementation and evaluation of several fundamental machine learning algorithms on example datasets. It serves as a practical introduction to supervised learning techniques using Python.

## Models Implemented

- **Linear Regression**  
  Used for predicting continuous target variables based on one or more features.

- **Logistic Regression**  
  Applied to binary classification problems by modeling the probability of class membership.

- **Decision Trees**  
  A non-parametric model used for both classification and regression tasks that splits data based on feature values.

- **Random Forest**  
  An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their outputs to improve accuracy and control overfitting.

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
  A simple, instance-based classification or regression algorithm that predicts outputs based on the closest training examples in feature space.
